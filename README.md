# Udacity-Project-Communicate-Data-Findings

## Description

I completed this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree program. It shows my ability to use pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn to create exploratory and explanatory data visualizations. The data used for the project comes from a bike-sharing system in the San Francisco Bay area. It is not included in this repository as it is part of Udacity's course materials and I don't want to share it without permission.
